### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
A license is important since it decides how your code can be used/changed/distributed. If you want to make your code available to everyone 
and for their changes to also be available, you would need a copyleft license. If you do want to commercialize your code, you would need to
apply a different license.

### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
