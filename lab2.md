### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
A license is important since it decides how your code can be used/changed/distributed. If you want to make your code available to everyone 
and for their changes to also be available, you would need a copyleft license. If you do want to commercialize your code, you would need to
apply a different license.

### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
There could be legal issues if you use someone's code without permission. The licenses tell you what permissions you have with code. Any code written is under copyright, so using it could be illegal.

### Why the Web beat Gopher
I agree with the author's claims on why the WWW beat Gopher. The WWW was funded and developed by CERN, while Gopher was created on a university campus. They already have the advantage of funds and developers. The WWW developers were thinking of a global scale when they started on the project while the Gopher developers were originally making something for the campus to use. Another factor was that the WWW developers used the open source tactic much more effectively.

### Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justification for ONE is enough).
#### Android - Apache License 2.0
This license allows the users to make changes to the code for themselves. If they do want to redistribute, they have to make sure their changes are noted in the code. This probably protects Android from being blamed for different sources of their code. It is also very compatible with GPL which its kernel uses.

### Think of an example project. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github.
Project to make a plugin for browsers to erase all data from online airplane/travel ticket sites. Picked MIT license so everyone can benefit and don't know if its illegal or not so I won't be held responsible.

### Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good - write 5 to 10 sentences. You may use tldrlegal.
For the common good, the LGPL would be best. Its description is that it is mostly for libararies which the general public, like myself, use. For developers, the GPL license would be best. It doesn't allow other contributors to include their names so the original developer gets all the credit. For a company, Apache would be best. It does not hold them liable and let them sublicense for money.

### Project
One of my friends is currently leading an RCOS project and the project seems fun. I am hoping he'll let me work on it. If not, back to more googling.
